## Introduction
The study aims to analyze the impact of river migration and land use dynamics using supervised classification methods. The project compares various machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate model for LULC classification.

## Objectives
- To utilize multispectral satellite images for LULC classification.
- To compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
- To analyze the impact of river erosion in the Malda district.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and machine learning.
- **Google Earth Engine**: For satellite image processing.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: SVM, Random Forest, ANN.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting the analysis process.

## Data Sources
- **Landsat 8 and 9**: `LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T2_L2` and `LANDSAT/LC09/C02/T1_L2`
